# Election Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview 
A client who works for the Colorado Board of Elections has tasked us with auditing a local election to determine the outcome.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast. 
    The total number of votes cast was 369,711 ballots for the US Congressional precinct in Colorado.

2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes. 
    The candidates for the election cycle were:
    Charles Casper Stockham
    Diana DeGette
    Raymon Anthony Doane

3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved. 
    Each candidate had the following vote count:
    Charles Casper Stockham: (85,213)
    Diana DeGette: (272,892)
    Raymon Anthony Doane: (11,606)

4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
    Each candidate had the following percentage of votes:
    Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% 
    Diana DeGette: 73.8% 
    Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% 

5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
    According to popular vote, the winner of the election was Diana DeGette - as she recieved 272,892 votes (a clear majority).
